# OmegaT setup

OmegaT's default factory settings (with regards to user interface and some behaviour) are pretty old and not really suitable for all kinds os tasks. Tweaking the default preferences by hand one by one is tedious and error-prone, especially for large teams where preferences are expected to be homogeneous across the team. This automated customization removes the burden of doing that manually from translators working in a team (or any OmegaT user).

## What is this setup?

Default options in OmegaT user preferences are not always the most convenient ones (or not in line with modern CAT tool best practices) but they can be tweaked. This setup tweaks them for you and chooses the most convenient value for every option. On the other hand, OmegaT is extensible by means of scripts and plugins, and this setup adds those for you as well.

In a nutshell, this setup consists of tweaked preferences and configuration files as well as extensions in functionality by means of scripts and plugins.
